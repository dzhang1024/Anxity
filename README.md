### Anxity

A simple dungeon crawler that incorporates basic 2D game functions such as moving, animations, projectiles, and collision. Part of a bigger project to develop a 2D dungeon crawler. 

This game serves as my "spring board" into more advance game programming topics such as different menus, scene transitions, dialogue, and game design concepts in general.
