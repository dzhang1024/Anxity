To do list for the development of Anxity 

Legend: 
# = Done 
@ = Work in Progress

Gameplay/UI: 
- projectiles/weaponry @ #
* change projectile @ #
* Potentially make the firepoint in line with the player instead of arbitrarily chosen value  
- enemies
- health bar @ # 
- abilities
- scene transition 

Controls: 
- picking up items (button or walk over)

Features: 
- add items 
- last boss
- item/object animations 

Notes: 
- WIll probably have to simplify this game in terms mechanics and features 
because of a time crunch and also learning process
